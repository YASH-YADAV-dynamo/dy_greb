The sun dips low, a fiery kiss,
On clouds of gold and rose,
A gentle breeze through meadows sighs,
Where day to twilight slows.

The forest sleeps, in emerald cloak,
Beneath the moonlit sky,
A watchful tree, with branches strong,
Reaches towards the high.

A river flows, a silver thread,
Reflecting starry light,
Mysteries in its depths reside,
Hidden from mortal sight.

A lone wolf howls, a mournful song,
Across the sleeping land,
A yearning cry, a restless soul,
For freedom's open hand.

The city sleeps, a concrete maze,
Where dreams in darkness hide,
A million stories, whispered tales,
Beneath the moonlit tide.

The first faint light, a promise breaks,
The eastern sky aflame,
A new day dawns, with hope reborn,
And whispers of its name.

The world awakens, one by one,
From slumber's gentle hold,
A tapestry of life unfolds,
A story yet untold.
